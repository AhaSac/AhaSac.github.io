### **Project Experience**
<br>

#### **Special Equipment Institute, School of Energy Engineering · Research Training**
*Sep. 2023 - Present | Supervisor: Keming Li, Tenure-track Associate Professor (Team of Academician Jinyang Zheng)*

##### Lightweight Research on Reinforced Spherical Shells
- **Energy Saving and Emission Reduction Competition (2024.06)**: Served as Team Leader (First Rank), responsible for technical schemes, PPT preparation, and defense. Independently completed parametric modeling of zone-reinforced spherical shells, secondary development of Abaqus based on Python, and Isight optimization.
- **Research Collaboration (2024.06-2025.06)**: Assisted a master's student and several undergraduate students in completing their graduation theses, responsible for sampling, surrogate model establishment, and optimization scheme research.
- **Undergraduate Graduation Design (2025.12)**: Project initiated as "Lightweight Design of Airborne Liquid Hydrogen Storage Tanks", aiming to complete the lightweight design of the inner shell based on cryogenic strengthening and the lightweight design of the reinforced outer shell.
