### Introduction
I am a senior student at Zhejiang University majoring in **Process Equipment and Control Engineering** at the College of Energy Engineering. During my undergraduate years, I have been conducting scientific research under the supervision of Dr. Li Keming from the Institute of Special Equipment (Team of Academician Zheng Jinyang). My research focuses on finite element simulation, structural optimization, and buckling defect sensitivity.

### Project Experience


#### Scientific Research Training under Dr. Li Keming (Special Research Fellow, Academician Zheng Jinyang's Team)
2023.09-Present
##### Lightweight Design of Reinforced Spherical Shells
June 2024: Participated in Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction Competition as team leader, primary member. Responsible for technical planning, PPT preparation, and presentation. During the competition, completed parametric modeling of zone-reinforced spherical shells and reinforcement parameter optimization based on Isight.
Through June 2025: Assisted a master's student and multiple undergraduate students in completing their theses. Further completed sampling and surrogate model development, and optimization solution research.
December 2025: Completed undergraduate thesis proposal "Lightweight Design of Shipborne Liquid Hydrogen Storage Tank," planning to complete internal shell lightweight design with low-temperature reinforcement and external shell lightweight design through reinforcement.
##### Research on Reduction Coefficient of Externally Pressurized Closure
This research optimized fitting formulas and simulation methods based on the team's existing internal pressure defect sensitivity research approach, achieving end-to-end Python execution of preprocessing, postprocessing, and data collection.
Published one first-author EI conference paper at ASME PVP 2025 conference.
##### Zhejiang University - Hangyang Group Liquid Hydrogen Equipment Technology Joint Laboratory
Participated in shipborne liquid hydrogen sphere tank design and finite element analysis.
Completed material low-temperature performance sample design and finite element analysis.
##### Other Experiences
Developed software using tkinter library, implementing material database queries and reinforcement code generation.
Designed 3D-printed liquid hydrogen cryogenic nozzles.
Implemented batch processing and data extraction for Abaqus and Ansys combined with Python.
This method significantly improved the team's finite element computation speed and has been widely adopted, mentioned multiple times in team results.
External pressure spherical shell reinforcement weight reduction optimization analysis participated in the Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction Competition. I independently completed parametric finite element modeling of reinforced spherical shells, Python-based secondary development of Abaqus, batch processing of Abaqus, and reinforcement solution optimization based on Isight. Subsequently, this project was further refined as a graduate thesis research topic by a senior master's student, with research results published as a master's thesis.
#### SRTP Project "Motion Pose Sensing Based on Millimeter-Wave" with Dr. Guo Xiuzhen
2024.03-2025.05
Responsible for continuous data acquisition and signal processing algorithm development using TI's IWR1642BOOST millimeter-wave radar sensor.
Wrote Python programs and scripts to control radar on/off and record data via serial port. Achieved completely autonomous radar operation and continuous data transmission to subsequent algorithm processing.
Preprocessed multi-frame radar data into Micro-Doppler images. The obtained Micro-Doppler images were used as ResNet input for model training.
Developed user interface based on STM32 and Raspberry Pi, supporting user operation control on the touchscreen.
